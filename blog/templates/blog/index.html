                <p>Time saving is a valuable perk in most work places.
                    This program came out as a response for the paperwork
                    created during production requiring analysis and
                    sensible data categorization. This executable runs a stopwatch allowing you to create a time-stamp with the <b>datetime package</b> and log your process information
                    automatically, a PDF report containing raw data is created using the <b>FPDF module</b>, and can be accessed from anywhere online with the <b>Filestack client package</b>. Tkinter <b>messagebox module</b> is used to interact with the user. Save hours of paperwork and automate your process documentation with a single click.

                <p>
                    Data analysis is the main reason why I learnt Python. My working experience taught me that you can have lots of data, but knowing how to extract information is a different thing! This is a script in where a <b>random Pandas DataFrame</b> is created and plotted using <b>matplotlib</b>. A new set of values is created every second and the plot is updated automatically (after you press the button). The main goal in here was to <b>plot</b> the DataFrame graph <b>inside</b> the <b>Tkinter GUI</b> with the <b>FigureCanvasTkAgg module</b> from <b>matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg</b>, as to have an executable program that allows you to work and generate plots, further than just showing a graph with the <i>plt.show()</i> function.

                <h3>QRcode reader</h3>
                <p>
                    Thanks to Python, you can generate a QR code in 4 lines of script using the <b>qrtools package</b>, while doing a QR code reader happens to be a bit more tricky. This reader is personally one of the most interesting projects I have done, given the versatility of elements to combine between mouse click events, image manipulation and using computer vision for image analysing.<br>
                        The script starts by maximizing a transparent window on which the x and y coordinates of the mouse clicks will be used as variables with the <b>mouse package</b>  to generate an image with the <b>PIL ImageGrab package</b>, triggering the actual GUI and showing the created image to scan, <b>openCV</b> is used to detect if the image contains a QR code and the data will be displayed. An 'image-file.png' will be created and you may need sudo privileges to run the app, also you will need an existing QR code to scan before executing the script. Once you run the app click the top-left corner followed by clicking the bottom-right corner of the code you want to read.

                <h3>Shortest-path finder</h3>
                <p>
                    Networks are objects that contain nodes and edges (between a pair of nodes) that can be used to represent a wide variety of real-world situations. A common problem where these appear is in finding the shortest route between two nodes in a network. For instance, this could be the shortest distance between two cities, where the nodes represent the cities and the edges are roads connecting them. In this case, the weights of the edges would be their lengths.<br><br>
                        This code uses primarily the <b>NetworkX package</b> for working with trees and networks, aided by the <b>Matplotlib package</b> to plot the figure. The default algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes is <b>Dijkstra's algorithm</b> and can be used for problems as the <i>traveling salesperson problem</i> and the <i>route inspection problem.</i>
                        The red color lines are the examined edges between nodes 7 and 9, and in contrast with blue color is the "shortest path", meaning "fewest edges". Weight is an optional keyword argument added to make some routes preferable to others.

                <h3>SQL database Manager</h3>
                <p>
                    Databases are an excelent way of storing information, and should not be annoying to deal with. This project also came as a result of the paperwork created while managing a warehouse <b>inventory</b>. When launching the app for the first time a database with a profile table is created using the <b>sqlite3 package</b>. The app is managed through a GUI which displays real time data, you can Delete and Add new elements as you wish, while Editing a record will open a new window allowing you to modify the database record.

                <p>
                    The abilty to control time is a power many would like to have.
                        This project came as one of my earliest executables in Tkinter.
                        A timer was chosen to improve my understanding of loops
                        and IF statements, it uses the <b>math</b> and <b>datetime packages</b> to collect time events and updating the displayed text. This same stopwatch format is used among other apps created.
